To-do (Layouts):
	[x] Navbar
	[x] Found a way to modify all of Bootstrap without changing the framework too, too much (I'll need to customize it sometime though, just, not right now.) //box-sizing: border-box!!!
	[x] Edit the width to actually make it reasonable lol
	[ ] Sliding menu on the left
	- On scroll = navbar thing
	- Data population (DB)
